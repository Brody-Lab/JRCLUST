# Parameters
- `realignTraces` did not have a section field, causing crashes on `Config.save`; this has been fixed
- change sections for various filtering params to "preprocessing" rather than "spike detection"
# TracesController
- spike highlights were not clearing after toggling spikes off; this has been fixed
- annoying "Beginning/End of file" message triggered before reaching BOF/EOF; this has been fixed
# PreviewController
- spike highlights were not clearing after toggling spikes off; this has been fixed
- annoying "Beginning/End of file" message triggered before reaching BOF/EOF; this has been fixed
# Config
- ignoreSites was indexed with ismember(siteMap, ignoreSites), potentially causing OOB errors; this has been fixed
# various
- replace `isfile` with `exist(., 'file') == 2` and `isdir` with `exist(., 'dir') == 7`
- `exist` called without abs path returned false positives, leading to references to nonexistent files; this has been fixed

# Parameters
- `RDDetrendMode`: 'hidehiko' renamed to 'regress'
- `realignTraces` was overlooked; this has been fixed
- old2new parameter mapping moved into params.json
- `deprecated` field (with supported/partially supported subfields) added to params.json
# Config class
- `validateProp` method failed to check default string values because MATLAB is weird about "" strings; this has been fixed
- `save` method exported default params, not user-specified params; this has been fixed
- `oldParamSet` made a dependent property
- added `setCustomProp` method: Config no longer ignores params not found in the default set
- added `deprecatedParams` property: check for deprecated status when calling `setCustomProp`
- added `isV3Import` property: Config will export a new config file if this is true
- `save` method exports custom properties if there are any
# JRC class
- `saveFiles` saved binaries (raw/filtered traces, features) on sort without detect; this has been fixed
